# jaydensar.net

Before you ask; Why does this exist? I'll answer that for you.

1. Catch-all email is a massive plus. (any string of characters followed by `@jaydensar.net` is a valid email!)

2. I self-host various things. It is more convenient to have a valid SSL certificate instead of a self-signed one, and going to `jaydensar.net` instead of some random IP address that I'd have to remember.

3. Image hosting. It is quick and easy to send images automatically uploaded to `jaydensar.net`, instead of having to upload to some public image hosting site that's out of my control, potentially with size limits and weird compression.

As for why what's on the website is what it is, and why this repo exists? I don't know. Just wanted to put something there. And ways to contact me seemed useful, *just in case* it's needed.
